# UWC Changshu China VR Experience

[UWC Changshu China](http://www.uwcchina.org/en), a boarding school, currently 
has troubles with presenting itself to faraway students that are interested.
Due to financial stress it is usually impossible to come on campus to explore 
the location.

This application tries to rectify that by presenting a VR experience with 
which users can experience a fraction of the events that occur on campus.
